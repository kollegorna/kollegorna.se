As we approach the end of what will surely be regarded as a very peculiar year, for better or worse, we over at Kollegorna are ending 2016 with some major changes of our own.

### Eduardo Nunes is our newest partner

After working with us for little over a year, we have invited Eduardo Nunes to join us as our newest partner and Head of Design. We've been looking for someone to help drive the company forwards by strengthening our focus on design for a while now, and have found that person in Eduardo. He will be taking up the task of ensuring the quality of our products and services goes beyond the core engineering aspects we've always took great pride in obsessing over.

### Nikolay Lechev joins our design team

As a first step towards driving our design focus forwards, we are delighted to welcome Nikolay Lechev into our team. Nikolay is a very talented designer and frontend developer hailing from Plovdiv, Bulgaria, whose striking work and down-to-earth personality left quite an impression on us. He will be sharing his skills and expertise with our team and clients, and helping push the experience and interface of our products even further.

### Samuel Carlsson moves on

To cap a year of change, our former partner and tech wizard Samuel Carlsson has stepped down and joined long-time friends and partners Redeye as Technical Lead. We are immensely grateful to Samuel for all of his hard work and dedication to our company over the years, and wish him the best on his new endeavours. We look forward to continuing working with Redeye and Samuel in the future.

We are very excited to see what the future holds for Kollegorna, and feel more prepared than ever to face the challenges 2017 has in store for us. We hope you'll share those challenges with us.
