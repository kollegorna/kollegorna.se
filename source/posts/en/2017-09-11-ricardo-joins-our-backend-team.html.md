We are very excited to announce we have a brand new colleague: Ricardo Marques has just joined our star-studded backend lineup — and we couldn’t be happier. Ricardo hails from sunny Lisbon, Portugal, and brings with him several years of experience working on some really cool things.

After completing his master’s at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), he’s had short stints in research and consultancy, but eventually found his mojo working as a backend developer. Since then, he has helped build services like [tradiio.com](http://tradiio.com), [coinvision.co](http://coinvision.co), [pickit.today](http://pickit.today) and [strim.in](http://strim.in), among many others. We’re very happy to welcome him into our team, and look forward to all the great things we’ll be building together from now on. Bem-vindo, Ricardo!
