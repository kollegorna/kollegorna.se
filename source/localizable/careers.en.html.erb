        <h2>What it's like working here</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>You have big opportunities to <strong>influence your job and how we work</strong>.</li>
          <li>You'll enjoy a <strong>creative and smooth work environment</strong>.</li>
          <li>We're the best colleagues.</li>
          <li>Remote work = OK. We have our HQ in Stockholm but you're free to <strong>work from wherever you want within the Milky Way</strong>.</li>
          <li>As we're an international team English is the lingua franca internally. We also speak Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Greek, Slovak, Bulgarian and Lithuanianâ€¦</li>
          <li>Leave no colleague behind! You'll never end up on a long-term contract on your own at some clients' office.</li>
          <li><strong>25 days of paid vacation</strong> every year.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Development Days</strong> â€“ Every sixth week everyone is free to choose an area in which to boost their skills over three days: Thursday, Friday and Monday.</li>
          <li><strong>Company Development Days</strong> â€“ When we feel it's necessary to learn new stuff we take time off to do that. How often and how long varies. On the Company Development Days we pick a mutual thing to learn in contrast to the Personal Development Days where you pick freely what you want.</li>
          <li>Overtime is our enemy and should not exist. You work 9-5, 8â€“4, 10â€“6 or whatever suits you. If you can't stop building stuff then go do good deeds in open source!</li>
          <li>Workload: Every year has 224â€“229 work days depending on what days the Swedish national holidays occur. Out of these approx 170 will be spent on client work, since the following days are excluded: 25 vacation days, 22 personal development days and 5â€“10 days conference/training days.</li>
          <li><strong>Health/fitness benefits</strong> (up to 3000 SEK/year), insurance, doctors appointments during work. Staying healthy is vital to do a good day's work.</li>
          <li>Pension savings following Swedish standards ITP1/ITP2. This amounts to 4,5% of your monthly salary.</li>
          <li><strong>Company trips</strong>. We love travelling the world and make sure to go somewhere at least one time per year.</li>
          <li>Up to 350 SEK (approx â‚¬38, $50 or Â£30) each month to spend on <strong>stuff that makes you a better designer or developer</strong>. Upgrade your GitHub account? Play around with a VPS on Digital Ocean? Pro account on CodePen? Fill your ebook reader with an unhealthy amount of ebooks? It's your choice.</li>
          <li id="stapler">Your own stapler. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd4fj9Efl4s">To avoid fires</a>.</li>
          <li>A <strong>MacBook Pro</strong>, MacBook Air or whatever computer you prefer that runs OS X or Linux.</li>
          <li>Enjoy working the finest tools of the trade such as Slack, Trello, Quip, GitHub, Harvest and Basecamp. Among the things powering us are Heroku, Codeship, Honeybadger, New Relic and Skylight.</li>
          <li>Human love not enough for you? Kobot, our friendly company robot, will be there for you 24/7. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/persand/4940f40616299c76c720">Here's a list of some of the things he can do</a>.)</li>
