        <h1>Corporate Social Responsiblity</h1>
        <p>At Kollegorna, we are acutely aware of what a privilege it is to be able to live in a peaceful, open and free society. We believe such a society can only exist thanks to the tremendous courage and tireless work of people and organisations who are willing to pour their time and money into making the world a better place.</p>

        <p>So as a way to repay them, we seek to invest as much of our own time and expertise into social, economic and environmental causes that are helping make a difference. Whether by working pro-bono on projects we believe in, donating a part of our profits to organisations that foster equality or sponsoring local organisations promoting youth sports, we try to do our part in shaping the world into the amazing place we know it can be.</p>

          <h2>Why &amp; What</h2>

          <p>We like to think of our work and experience as the best gift we can offer any non-profit. Because we usually get deeply involved in the projects we support, we get to develop solutions that help these organisations in ways that far outweigh and outlast any contributions we could make ourselves.</p>

          <p>We try to take on 1 to 2 such projects a year and treat them as we would any other project — using the same methods, processes, tools and services we use in our client work. We don't have a strict policy on the kind of projects and organisations we support, but we try to invest in causes we believe to be important, and where we feel our contribution could have a greater and longer-lasting impact. </p>

          <h2>We've helped</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>ActionAid</li>
            <li>CAPJC</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>What's a pro bono project?</h2>

          <p>Projects we work on for free or for partial compensation. </p>

          <h2>How do you pick your projects?</h2>

          <p>It's a combination of many factors such as field of work, timing, impact, location, budget and challenges.</p>
          <p>We prefer projects where we can use all of our skills doing concepts, identity, design, development and strategy.</p>

          <h2>Will it be to my benefit if I have a budget?</h2>

          <p>Not necessarily, it depends on what kind of project you want to do.</p>

          <h2>Can you help me?</h2>

          <p>Get in touch with <a href="mailto:per@kollegorna.se">Per Sandström</a> and we'll see if your project is something that could fit us.</p>

          Glädjeverkstan - Clownmedicin is a Swedish organisation that brings clowns to hospitals for children and elderly. We used the camera and some basic face recognition to let the user clown itself by adding a clown nose. The campaign was made in a short sprint during the <a href="http://time.com/4518456/scary-clown-sighting-attack-craze/">clown rampage</a> that happened all over the world that autumn.</p>

          <p><strong>Presenter mot fattigdom / Gifts against poverty (2012 – 2014)</strong><br>
          <em>Service / eCommerce for ActionAid</em><br>
          A similar solution as the WaterAid Gift Shop, but for the Swedish chapter of ActionAid.</p>
