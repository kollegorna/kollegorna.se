      <h2>Celine Beyond wants to make cities sound better.</h2>

      <p class="highlight">With several years of experience working to improve the quality of sound in what is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Singapore-based acoustic consultants Soundzipper know just how unaware urban dwellers have become of the poor sound environment that surrounds them. So when they thought of ways to try to change that, they came to us.</p>

      <div class="additional">
        <p>Celine Beyond is Soundzipper's not-for-profit attempt at elevating access to good urban acoustics to the status of basic human right. Working in collaboration with sound enthusiasts throughout the world, they promote good practices in acoustics design within public and private enterprises, shining a light on a topic that is frequently forgotten, but that has a major impact on the quality of life of most urban populations.</p>
        <p>We were with them from the inception of the idea to its initial release, generating buzz around the launch and designing, developing and releasing their brand and website. The logo, a raw cross-over between a heart and a ear, was designed to serve as a guerrilla-style icon that can be easily and inexpensively tagged on anything to make it theirs. Paired with a vibrant neon-green and their tongue-in-cheek name, it makes for a brand that feels contemporary but hard to forget.</p>
