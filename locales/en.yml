    ivan:
        role: "Developer"
        intro: "I'm a web developer spending most of my time in the backend code, mostly ruby. I'm responsible for the under-the-hood stuff that you usually don't see but are needed to keep the engine running. When I'm not at the computer writing code, I spend my time perfecting my coffee making skills and going to the gym."
    raymall:
        role: "Front-End Developer"

        intro: "I'm a 21st century digital digital boy – a developer that always striving to learn something new in different fields.

    filippos:
        role: "Web Engineer"
        intro: "I am a web engineer, meaning that I love working on both sides of HTTP mostly using Ruby and Javascript, although I feel backend a more natural place for me. I have a pure interest in networked services and systems which even lead me to challenge conventional REST through Introspected REST (https://introspected.rest/) manifesto. Apart from software, I really like to read historical novels and play tennis."
    nikolay:
        role: "Front-End Developer, Designer"
        intro: "I'm a designer with a penchant for UX and great typography. I design and develop meaningful user-centered experiences, while trying to keep my Sketch and CSS files as maintainable as possible. My hobbies include questioning how I can improve my designs and code, the occasional book reading and traveling. I'm also learning photography, for the joy of it."
    osvaldas:
        role: "Front-End Developer, Designer"
        intro: "“Web designer who thinks in code” perfectly describes what I do: I solve design problems and implement their technical solutions. My specialisation covers front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), front-end performance, accessibility and usability. I also do UI/UX design occasionally."
    ricardo:
        role: "Developer"
        intro: "I'm a Fullstack Developer with a keen eye for data and algorithmic challenges. Big fan of adopting state-of-the-art technologies, I'm always ready to dive into building disrupting products. Besides engineering, I like to spend my days travelling, relaxing on a beach or hitting some shots around a tennis court."
